# BAG-To-CSV
This Python script scrapes the German Federal Labour Court website, extracting key information from its PDF decisions and converting them to TXT files. The User can choose how many pages (50 decisions per page) to scrape, and the TXT files are saved in folders corresponding to the PDF filenames. Relevant information is also saved in a CSV file. An executable file made with `pyinstaller` is included for Windows. The collected data can be used for NLP and ML algorithms to develop an automated system that applies labor law decisions to similar cases. This could significantly advance legal technology and benefit legal professionals.
